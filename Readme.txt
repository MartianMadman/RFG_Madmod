Madmod is a large overhaul mod that aims to make the game a much better experience. It affects both the gameplay and visuals and also greatly extends the length of the main campaign. Starting a new game is required for all changes of this mod to properly take effect. This mod is most likely to be incompatible with other mod manager mods and does not affect the dlc.

\Initial release changes/
(Reverted)-Small 3d items like dropped weapons or empty clips will never despawn. This will inevitably cause strange things to happen but I haven't had it cause crashes so that's good. Loading a save will despawn them and fix the issue. 
-Increased amount of EDF control for all sectors to force players to partake in many more guerrilla activities per sector and makes the overall game a much longer experience.
-Npcs on the same team can not damage each other. Prevents hordeâ€™s from accidentally killing their own people during combat. Players can still kill npcs.
-Major improvements to the way explosions are handled. Explosions will blast away any structure with ease including those pesky steel beams.
-Tweaks to alert_level.xtbl. To lose alert level either hide for a minute or drive far away from the crime scene.
-Removed bullet push force on ragdolls to add more variety to the ways they fall down after death.

\Install from github/
This mod is made to work with RFG Mod Manager and doesn't need to be packed by the developer to work. To install from github you'll first obviously need to download the repository files. Then download the Mod Manager for RFG which can be found at (https://www.factionfiles.com/ff.php?action=search&pageaction=searchfiles&search_query=mod+manager&file_searchby=7&file_searchgame=3&file_searchcat=&file_sort=5) Use the readme in the Mod Manager download to read up on how to use it. Only the Mod Manager for the original RFG has the readme which is a bit inconvenient. Once done with that, go to the source directory of Madmod and depending on which version of RFG you use, copy either the Classic or Remaster directory into the mods folder of Mod Manager. Optionally you should rename the directory you copied to Madmod after you've put it in the mods folder. At this point you should be good to go and Mod Manager should be able to install it from here.

\Issues/ 
-Some guerrilla activities are locked behind missions so if you are unable to get sector control to zero then try completing the missions. Other activites may also need low sector control before showing up.
-Player animations not working on classic RFG until you change weapons.
